### Basic Server setups in various languages
Each server is saved to its own branch.

To setup a project with one of the servers do the following:

- `mkdir <project_name>` in the directory you wish to install it.
- `git init`
- `git remote add origin git@github.com:MaxProvin/servers.git`
- `git pull origin <branch_name>`
- `bundle`
